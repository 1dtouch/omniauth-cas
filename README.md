# OmniAuth CAS Strategy [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/dlindahl/omniauth-cas.png)](http://travis-ci.org/dlindahl/omniauth-cas)

A CAS Strategy for OmniAuth.

I didn't really want to do this, but no one else has, so I might as well give it a stab.

This is highly experimental, use at your own risk!
